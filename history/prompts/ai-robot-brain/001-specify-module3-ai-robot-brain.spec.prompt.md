# Prompt

Module 3 – The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)

Purpose:
Author Module 3 of "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics," focusing on advanced perception, navigation, and training using NVIDIA Isaac.

Target Audience:
CS/AI students familiar with ROS 2 and simulation concepts.

Learning Outcomes:
- Understand photorealistic simulation and synthetic data generation
- Use Isaac ROS for accelerated perception and VSLAM
- Apply Nav2 for humanoid path planning and navigation

Chapters (Docusaurus):
1. NVIDIA Isaac and AI-Driven Robotics
2. Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data Generation
3. Isaac ROS: VSLAM and Perception
4. Nav2 for Humanoid Navigation

# Response

Successfully created the specification for Module 3 - The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™). The specification includes:

- Four prioritized user stories covering Isaac fundamentals, simulation, perception, and navigation
- Detailed functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-010)
- Key entities related to educational modules, simulation environments, perception pipelines, and navigation configurations
- Measurable success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) with specific outcomes
- Edge cases for various failure scenarios
- A quality checklist confirming the specification meets all requirements

The specification is technology-agnostic, focuses on user value, and provides clear acceptance scenarios for each user story. It's ready for the planning phase.
