## Response snapshot

Generated comprehensive implementation tasks for the ROS 2 educational module. The tasks.md file includes 69 specific, actionable tasks organized across 7 phases:

1. **Setup Phase**: Initialize Docusaurus project and basic structure
2. **Foundational Phase**: Core documentation infrastructure and standards
3. **User Story 1**: Chapter 1 on ROS 2 fundamentals and embodied intelligence
4. **User Story 2**: Chapter 2 on nodes, topics, and services
5. **User Story 3**: Chapter 3 on Python agents with rclpy
6. **User Story 4**: Chapter 4 on humanoid modeling with URDF
7. **Polish Phase**: Assessments, quality checks, and final configurations

Each task follows the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. The tasks are organized by user story priority (P1-P4) and include dependency information, parallel execution opportunities, and implementation strategy. All tasks align with the functional requirements from the specification and support the measurable success criteria.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown for ROS 2 module implementation
- 🧪 Tests: null
