# ROS 2 Module - The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the ROS 2 Module, where you'll learn how ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) serves as the "nervous system" connecting AI agents to humanoid robots. This module is designed for CS/AI students with Python basics who are new to robotics.

## About This Module

This module consists of four comprehensive chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

### Chapter 1: ROS 2 and Embodied Intelligence
Learn how ROS 2 serves as middleware connecting AI agents to robotic hardware and understand its role in Physical AI.

### Chapter 2: ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services
Master the core communication patterns that enable different components of a robotic system to communicate effectively.

### Chapter 3: Python Agents with rclpy
Discover how to bridge your existing Python AI knowledge with ROS 2 using the rclpy library.

### Chapter 4: Humanoid Modeling with URDF
Understand how humanoid robots are modeled in ROS 2 using the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF).

## Learning Outcomes

After completing this module, you will be able to:
- Explain the role of ROS 2 in Physical AI applications
- Implement ROS 2 communication patterns (nodes, topics, services)
- Connect Python AI agents to ROS 2 using rclpy
- Interpret and understand URDF files for humanoid robots

## Target Audience

This module is designed for:
- CS/AI students with Python basics
- Developers new to robotics
- Anyone interested in connecting AI algorithms with physical robotic systems

Let's begin your journey into the world of ROS 2 and Physical AI!
