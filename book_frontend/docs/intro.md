# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## A Comprehensive Guide to Embodied Intelligence and Humanoid Robots

Welcome to the AI Agent Factory educational platform! This comprehensive resource is designed to guide you through the exciting intersection of artificial intelligence and robotics, with a particular focus on creating AI agents that can interact with the physical world.

## Module 1: ROS 2 - The Robotic Nervous System

In this foundational module, you'll learn about ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) and how it serves as the middleware connecting AI agents to humanoid robots. This module consists of four comprehensive chapters:

1. [ROS 2 and Embodied Intelligence](./ros2-module/chapter-1-ros2-embodied-intelligence.md) - Introduction to ROS 2's role in Physical AI
2. [ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services](./ros2-module/chapter-2-nodes-topics-services.md) - Core communication patterns in ROS 2
3. [Python Agents with rclpy](./ros2-module/chapter-3-python-agents-rclpy.md) - Connecting Python AI agents with ROS 2
4. [Humanoid Modeling with URDF](./ros2-module/chapter-4-humanoid-modeling-urdf.md) - Robot modeling using Unified Robot Description Format

Each chapter builds upon the previous ones, providing a comprehensive introduction to ROS 2 for AI practitioners.
